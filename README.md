# YourMovies

A Reactjs app that allows you to search for movies and view the top 10 results, including the movie's title, year of release, and imdb poster.

The app works by accessing the 'OMDB' API through an API key.

## Localhost Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Functionality

Using the searchbar, type in the name of the movie you would like to look for.

Specific names will yield specific results, whereas a general search (such as 'Superman') will yield the top 10 movies found with that search term.
